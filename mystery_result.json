  "story": "*Day 1* \n \n December 27th. The date of the incident has finally been made public. I am Detective Haines from Quiet Town in upstate New York where the crime took place and we are all hoping for a happy ending for your family after such an awful tragedy that left so many unanswered questions. My name is Mrs Riker and my son Aaron was murdered by what nobody believes to be murderers just last night at about eight thirty pm. It happened while he walked home alone with no car or driver nearby as if they knew something about him which makes it even more suspicious than usual since there were no known enemies or people who wanted anything bad out of him especially because his parents worked abroad most of the time but still nothing makes sense other than these killers being close enough to know this was going on. This explains why nobody suspected foul play apart from me until later when she found her husband\u2019s body lying faced down face down under our stairs covered in blood that led us straight towards you Mr Barnes aka reporter / journalist/ novelist etc. Anyway here's part two:\n [ EDIT ] \n\n *Day 2* \n December 28th. Another day, another newspaper article written on this case. As far as anyone knows right now everything went perfectly well yesterday evening till tonight due to several anonymous tips received through both phones calls and letters asking not only us but also certain members of local media outlets like yourself whom work tirelessly trying their best to solve any mystery regardless how big/small it may seem including myself whose own job depends upon solving problems immediately before its too late! Well then anyway sorry guys I can't continue anymore let alone answer lots more questions nor publish new articles every single minute concerning... Let me start from scratch.. What really happened? Why did that poor kid die? Who killed him?? And can someone please explain this??? Oh shit guess what?! Your next installment should cover those answers along WITH your OWN personal account regarding today & tomorrow mornings events leading up TO THE GROUND ZERO",
